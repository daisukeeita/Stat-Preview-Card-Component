### What I learned

    What I learned in this challenge is the planning of the 'ecosystem' in programming. Since this challenge looks like a simple one, I thought that this is going to be a fast challenge. And without looking very well at the given design and materials, I was stuck at the weird looking image once I got into the desktop section and, oh-boy, I need to re-structure the HTML itself due to having two different set of images.
